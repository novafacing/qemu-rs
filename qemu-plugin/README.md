# QEMU-PLUGIN

High level idiomatic Rust bindings to the QEMU Plugin API, including tools to build
QEMU plugins in Rust.

## Example

Below is a minimal plugin example for a plugin which prints the execution trace of the
program running in QEMU. Notice that all we do is register a struct which implements
`Plugin` in a library constructor, and the library takes care of the rest.

```rust,ignore
use anyhow::Result;
use ctor::ctor;
use qemu_plugin::{
    plugin::{HasCallbacks, Plugin, Register, init_plugin},
    PluginId, TranslationBlock,
};

struct TinyTrace;

impl Register for TinyTrace {}

impl HasCallbacks for TinyTrace {
    fn on_translation_block_translate(
        &mut self,
        _id: PluginId,
        tb: TranslationBlock,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        tb.instructions().enumerate().try_for_each(|(idx, insn)| {
            if idx == 0 {
                println!("====TB: {:08x}", insn.vaddr());
            }

            println!("{:08x}: {}", insn.vaddr(), insn.disas()?);
            Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())
        })?;

        Ok(())
    }
}

#[ctor]
fn init() {
    init_plugin(TinyTrace).expect("Failed to initialize plugin");
}
```

The above `src/lib.rs` in a Cargo project with the following `Cargo.toml` will compile to
`libtiny.so`, which can be loaded in QEMU by running `qemu-system-ARCH -plugin ./libtiny.so`.

```toml
[package]
name = "tiny"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
qemu-plugin = "9.2.0-v0"
anyhow = "1.0.75"
ffi = "0.1.0"
ctor = "0.2.6"
```

## Versioning

As of QEMU 8.2.4, the QEMU plugin API has more than a single version. This enables some
great features like register inspection and conditional callbacks. Versioning is
implemented in the `qemu-plugin` crate via compile-time features, because a dynamic
library can only be compatible with one version at a time. To choose a version, set a
listing like:

```toml
qemu-plugin = { version = "9.1.2-v0", features = ["plugin-api-v2"], default-features = false }
```

The `qemu-plugin` crate's default plugin version is set to the latest version that is
officially released in QEMU. Currently, this is V4, released in 9.2.0. If you need a
different version, you *must* set `default-features = false`.
